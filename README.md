# Simple Interest Calculator Project

## Project Description
This project contains a Bash script that calculates simple interest based on user input. The user is prompted to enter the principal amount, the annual rate of interest, and the time period in years. The script then computes the simple interest using the formula:

Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

This project is part of the Final Project: Introduction to Git and GitHub course.
